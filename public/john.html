You came not of one mother then, it seems.

<b class="speaker">BASTARD</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-84">
Most certain of one mother, mighty king;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-85">
That is well known; and, as I think, one father:

<span class="line" id="0-0-86">
But for the certain knowledge of that truth
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-87">
I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:

<span class="line" id="0-0-88">
Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.

I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;

That is my brother's plea and none of mine;

The which if he can prove, a' pops me out

Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!

Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?

<b class="speaker">BASTARD</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-102">
I know not why, except to get the land.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-103">
But once he slander'd me with bastardy:

But whether I be as true begot or no,

<span class="line" id="0-0-105">
That still I lay upon my mother's head,

Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-108">
Compare our faces and be judge yourself.

If old sir Robert did beget us both

O old sir Robert, father, on my knee

I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!

Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">QUEEN ELINOR</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-116">
He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-117">
The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-118">
Do you not read some tokens of my son

<span class="line" id="0-0-119">
In the large composition of this man?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING JOHN</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-121">
Mine eye hath well examined his parts

And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-123">
What doth move you to claim your brother's land?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BASTARD</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-125">
Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-126">
With half that face would he have all my land:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-127">
A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROBERT</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-129">
My gracious liege, when that my father lived,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-130">
Your brother did employ my father much,--
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-130">130</a>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BASTARD</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-132">
Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-133">
Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROBERT</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-135">
And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-136">
To Germany, there with the emperor
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-137">
To treat of high affairs touching that time.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-138">
The advantage of his absence took the king
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-139">
And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-140">
Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-140">140</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-141">
But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-142">
Between my father and my mother lay,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-143">
As I have heard my father speak himself,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-144">
When this same lusty gentleman was got.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-145">
Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-146">
His lands to me, and took it on his death
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-147">
That this my mother's son was none of his;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-148">
And if he were, he came into the world
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-149">
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-150">
Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-150">150</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-151">
My father's land, as was my father's will.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING JOHN</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-153">
Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-154">
Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-155">
And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-156">
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-157">
That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-158">
Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-159">
Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-160">
In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-160">160</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-161">
This calf bred from his cow from all the world;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-162">
In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-163">
My brother might not claim him; nor your father,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-164">
Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-165">
My mother's son did get your father's heir;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-166">
Your father's heir must have your father's land.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROBERT</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-168">
Shall then my father's will be of no force
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-169">
To dispossess that child which is not his?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BASTARD</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-171">
Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-172">
Than was his will to get me, as I think.
</span>
</p>
<p>

Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
