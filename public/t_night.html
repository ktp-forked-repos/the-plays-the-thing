The appetite may sicken, and so die.

That strain again! it had a dying fall:

O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,

That breathes upon a bank of violets,

Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:

Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy

This is Illyria, lady.

And what should I do in Illyria?

<span class="line" id="0-1-8">
My brother he is in Elysium.

Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>

It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
</span>

<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-13">
O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.

True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,

Assure yourself, after our ship did split,

When you and those poor number saved with you

Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,

Most provident in peril, bind himself,

Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,

To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-22">
Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-23">
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves

So long as I could see.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>

For saying so, there's gold:

Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,

Whereto thy speech serves for authority,

Not three hours' travel from this very place.

Who governs here?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>

A noble duke, in nature as in name.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-38">
What is the name?
</span>

Orsino.

<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-42">
Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-43">
He was a bachelor then.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-45">
And so is now, or was so very late;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-46">
For but a month ago I went from hence,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-47">
And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-48">
What great ones do the less will prattle of,--
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-49">
That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.

What's she?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-53">
A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-54">
That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-55">
In the protection of his son, her brother,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-56">
Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-57">
They say, she hath abjured the company
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-58">
And sight of men.

<span class="line" id="0-1-60">
O that I served that lady
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-60">60</a>
</span>

And might not be delivered to the world,

Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,

What my estate is!

<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-65">
That were hard to compass;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-66">
Because she will admit no kind of suit,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-67">
No, not the duke's.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">VIOLA</b>

There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;

And though that nature with a beauteous wall

<span class="line" id="0-1-71">
Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-72">
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-73">
With this thy fair and outward character.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-74">
I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-75">
Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-76">
For such disguise as haply shall become
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-77">
The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-78">
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-79">
It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-80">
And speak to him in many sorts of music
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-80">80</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-81">
That will allow me very worth his service.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-82">
What else may hap to time I will commit;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-83">
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-85">
Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-86">
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
