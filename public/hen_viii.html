I come no more to make you laugh: things now,

<span class="line" id="0-0-3">
That bear a weighty and a serious brow,

Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,

Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,

<span class="line" id="0-0-6">
We now present. Those that can pity, here
</span>

May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;
</span>

The subject will deserve it. Such as give

Their money out of hope they may believe,

May here find truth too. Those that come to see

</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-11">
Only a show or two, and so agree

The play may pass, if they be still and willing,

I'll undertake may see away their shilling

Richly in two short hours. Only they

<span class="line" id="0-0-15">
That come to hear a merry bawdy play,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-16">
A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-17">
In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
</span>

Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,

<span class="line" id="0-0-19">
To rank our chosen truth with such a show

As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting

Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,
</span>

To make that only true we now intend,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-23">
Will leave us never an understanding friend.

Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known

<span class="line" id="0-0-25">
The first and happiest hearers of the town,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-26">
Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-27">
The very persons of our noble story
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-28">
As they were living; think you see them great,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-29">
And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-30">
Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-30">30</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-31">
How soon this mightiness meets misery:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-32">
And, if you can be merry then, I'll say
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-33">
A man may weep upon his wedding-day.

In their embracement, as they grew together;

The view of earthly glory: men might say,

Till this time pomp was single, but now married

To one above itself. Each following day

All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,

Made Britain India: every man that stood

Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were

As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,

Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear

The pride upon them, that their very labour

Was to them as a painting: now this masque

Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night

Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,

Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
</span>

Still him in praise: and, being present both

'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner

Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,

The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed

To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder

That such a keech can with his very bulk

Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun

And keep it from the earth.

Surely, sir,

There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;

For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace

Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,

The force of his own merit makes his way

A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys

A place next to the king.

I'll tell you in a little. The great duke
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-32">
Came to the bar; where to his accusations
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-33">
He pleaded still not guilty and alleged
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-34">
Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-35">
The king's attorney on the contrary
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-36">
Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-37">
Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-38">
To have brought viva voce to his face:
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-39">
At which appear'd against him his surveyor;
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-40">
Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,
  <a class="line" href="#2-0-40">40</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-41">
Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,
</span>

Hopkins, that made this mischief.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Gentleman</b>

The same.

<span class="line" id="2-0-48">
All these accused him strongly; which he fain
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-49">
Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-50">
And so his peers, upon this evidence,
  <a class="line" href="#2-0-50">50</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-51">
Have found him guilty of high treason. Much
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-52">
He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-53">
Was either pitied in him or forgotten.
</span>
</p>

After all this, how did he bear himself?

When he was brought again to the bar, to hear

With such an agony, he sweat extremely,

And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:
  <a class="line" href="#2-0-60">60</a>
</span>

But he fell to himself again, and sweetly
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-0-62">
In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.

A distance from her; while her grace sat down

At length her grace rose, and with modest paces

Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly.

<h3>SCENE II.  Kimbolton. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter KATHARINE, Dowager, sick; led between
GRIFFITH, her gentleman usher, and PATIENCE, her woman</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GRIFFITH</b>
<span class="line" id="4-1-3">
How does your grace?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KATHARINE</b>
<span class="line" id="4-1-5">
O Griffith, sick to death!
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-6">
My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-7">
Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-8">
So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-9">
Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-10">
That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?
  <a class="line" href="#4-1-10">10</a>

<b class="speaker">GRIFFITH</b>
<span class="line" id="4-1-12">
Yes, madam; but I think your grace,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-13">
Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KATHARINE</b>
<span class="line" id="4-1-15">
Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-16">
If well, he stepp'd before me, happily
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-17">
For my example.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GRIFFITH</b>
<span class="line" id="4-1-19">
Well, the voice goes, madam:
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-20">
For after the stout Earl Northumberland
  <a class="line" href="#4-1-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-21">
Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-22">
As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-23">
He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-24">
He could not sit his mule.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KATHARINE</b>
<span class="line" id="4-1-26">
Alas, poor man!
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GRIFFITH</b>
<span class="line" id="4-1-28">
At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-29">
Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-30">
With all his covent, honourably received him;
  <a class="line" href="#4-1-30">30</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-31">
To whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-32">
An old man, broken with the storms of state,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-33">
Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-34">
Give him a little earth for charity!'
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-35">
So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-36">
Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-37">
About the hour of eight, which he himself
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-38">
Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-39">
Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-40">
He gave his honours to the world again,
  <a class="line" href="#4-1-40">40</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-41">
His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KATHARINE</b>
<span class="line" id="4-1-43">
So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-44">
Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-45">
And yet with charity. He was a man
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-46">
Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-47">
Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-48">
Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-49">
His own opinion was his law: i' the presence
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-50">
He would say untruths; and be ever double
  <a class="line" href="#4-1-50">50</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-51">
Both in his words and meaning: he was never,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-52">
But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-53">
His promises were, as he then was, mighty;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-54">
But his performance, as he is now, nothing:
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-55">
Of his own body he was ill, and gave
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-56">
The clergy in example.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GRIFFITH</b>
<span class="line" id="4-1-58">

This cardinal,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-67">
Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-68">
Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-69">
He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-70">
Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:
  <a class="line" href="#4-1-70">70</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-71">
Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-72">
But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-73">
And though he were unsatisfied in getting,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-74">
Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-75">
He was most princely: ever witness for him
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-76">
Those twins Of learning that he raised in you,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-77">
Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-78">
Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;

The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,

So excellent in art, and still so rising,

</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-81">
That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-82">
His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-83">
For then, and not till then, he felt himself,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-84">
And found the blessedness of being little:
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-85">
And, to add greater honours to his age
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-1-86">
Than man could give him, he died fearing God.

<p class="stagedir">The vision. Enter, solemnly tripping one after
another, six personages, clad in white robes,
wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden
vizards on their faces; branches of bays or palm in
their hands. They first congee unto her, then
dance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold
a spare garland over her head; at which the other
four make reverent curtsies; then the two that held
the garland deliver the same to the other next two,
who observe the same order in their changes, and
holding the garland over her head: which done,
they deliver the same garland to the last two, who
likewise observe the same order: at which, as it
were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs
of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven:
and so in their dancing vanish, carrying the
garland with them. The music continues</p>
