True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,

Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;

Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out

Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;

My lord and you were then at Mantua:--

Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,

When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple

Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,

She could have run and waddled all about;
</span>

And then my husband--God be with his soul!

Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,

And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
