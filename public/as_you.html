As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-4">
bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-5">
and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-6">
blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-7">
sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-8">
report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-9">
he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-10">
properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you

</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-11">
that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-12">
differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-13">
are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-14">
with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-15">
and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-16">
brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-17">
which his animals on his dunghills are as much
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-18">
bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-19">
plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-20">
me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-21">
me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
</span>

brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-23">
gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-24">
grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-25">
think is within me, begins to mutiny against this

<span class="line" id="0-0-26">
servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I

There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:

<span class="line" id="0-0-131">
that is, the old duke is banished by his younger

Hath not old custom made this life more sweet

Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods

More free from peril than the envious court?

Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,

The seasons' difference, as the icy fang

And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,

Almost to bursting, and the big round tears

Coursed one another down his innocent nose

Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,

Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,

Full of the pasture, jumps along by him

<h3>SCENE VII.  The forest. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and
Lords like outlaws</p>

<b class="speaker">DUKE SENIOR</b>
<span class="line" id="1-6-3">
I think he be transform'd into a beast;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-4">
For I can no where find him like a man.

<p>
<b class="speaker">First Lord</b>
<span class="line" id="1-6-6">
My lord, he is but even now gone hence:
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-7">
Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
</span>

If he, compact of jars, grow musical,

We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.

He saves my labour by his own approach.

<b class="speaker">DUKE SENIOR</b>
<span class="line" id="1-6-16">
Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-17">
That your poor friends must woo your company?
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-18">
What, you look merrily!

A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,
  <a class="line" href="#1-6-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-21">
A motley fool; a miserable world!
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-22">
As I do live by food, I met a fool
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-23">
Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-24">
And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-25">
In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-26">
'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-27">
'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-28">
And then he drew a dial from his poke,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-29">
And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-30">
Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:
  <a class="line" href="#1-6-30">30</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-31">
Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-32">
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-33">
And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-34">
And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-35">
And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-36">
And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-37">
The motley fool thus moral on the time,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-38">
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-39">
That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-40">
And I did laugh sans intermission
  <a class="line" href="#1-6-40">40</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-41">
An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-42">
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SENIOR</b>
<span class="line" id="1-6-44">
What fool is this?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JAQUES</b>
<span class="line" id="1-6-46">
O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-47">
And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-48">
They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-49">
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-50">
After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
  <a class="line" href="#1-6-50">50</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-51">
With observation, the which he vents
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-52">
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-53">
I am ambitious for a motley coat.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SENIOR</b>
<span class="line" id="1-6-55">
Thou shalt have one.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JAQUES</b>
<span class="line" id="1-6-57">
It is my only suit;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-58">
Provided that you weed your better judgments
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-59">
Of all opinion that grows rank in them
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-60">
That I am wise. I must have liberty
  <a class="line" href="#1-6-60">60</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-61">
Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-62">
To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-63">
And they that are most galled with my folly,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-64">
They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-65">
The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-66">
He that a fool doth very wisely hit
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-67">
Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-68">
Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-69">
The wise man's folly is anatomized
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-70">
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
  <a class="line" href="#1-6-70">70</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-71">
Invest me in my motley; give me leave
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-72">
To speak my mind, and I will through and through
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-73">
Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-74">
If they will patiently receive my medicine.

Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:
  <a class="line" href="#1-6-80">80</a>
</span>

For thou thyself hast been a libertine,

Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,

What woman in the city do I name,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-92">
When that I say the city-woman bears
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-93">
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?

<span class="line" id="1-6-94">
Who can come in and say that I mean her,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-95">
When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-96">
Or what is he of basest function

That says his bravery is not of my cost,

Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits

His folly to the mettle of my speech?

There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein

My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,

Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,

Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,

Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-173">
This wide and universal theatre
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-174">
Presents more woeful pageants than the scene

Wherein we play in.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JAQUES</b>
<span class="line" id="1-6-177">
All the world's a stage,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-178">
And all the men and women merely players:
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-179">
They have their exits and their entrances;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-180">
And one man in his time plays many parts,
  <a class="line" href="#1-6-180">180</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-181">
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-182">
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-183">
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-184">
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-185">
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-186">
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-187">
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-188">
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-189">
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-190">
Seeking the bubble reputation
  <a class="line" href="#1-6-190">190</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-191">
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-192">
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-193">
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-194">
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-195">
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-196">
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-197">
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-198">
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-199">
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-200">
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
  <a class="line" href="#1-6-200">200</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-201">
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-202">
That ends this strange eventful history,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-6-203">
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,

Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
