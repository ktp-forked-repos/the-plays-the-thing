Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:

<span class="line" id="0-0-4">
Is this a holiday? what! know you not,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-5">
Being mechanical, you ought not walk

Upon a labouring day without the sign

Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?

Why, sir, a carpenter.

You, sir, what trade are you?

Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-16">
as you would say, a cobbler.
</span>

<p>
<b class="speaker">MARULLUS</b>

But what trade art thou? answer me directly.
</span>
</p>

<b class="speaker">Second Commoner</b>

A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe

What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?

<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Commoner</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-25">
Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,
</span>

if you be out, sir, I can mend you.

What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!

Why, sir, cobble you.

Thou art a cobbler, art thou?

Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I

meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's

matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon

to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I

Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself

into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,

to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARULLUS</b>

Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
</span>

What tributaries follow him to Rome,

To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?

You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!

O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,

Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft

<span class="line" id="0-0-54">
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,

<span class="line" id="0-0-55">
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-56">
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-57">
The livelong day, with patient expectation,

<span class="line" id="0-0-58">
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-59">
And when you saw his chariot but appear,

<span class="line" id="0-0-60">
Have you not made an universal shout,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-60">60</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-61">
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-62">
To hear the replication of your sounds
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-63">
Made in her concave shores?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-64">
And do you now put on your best attire?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-65">
And do you now cull out a holiday?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-66">
And do you now strew flowers in his way
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-67">
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-68">
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-69">
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-70">
That needs must light on this ingratitude.

Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,

Assemble all the poor men of your sort;

Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears

Into the channel, till the lowest stream

Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.

They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.

Go you down that way towards the Capitol;

This way will I disrobe the images,

May we do so?

You know it is the feast of Lupercal.

It is no matter; let no images

<span class="line" id="0-0-88">
Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,

And drive away the vulgar from the streets:

So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-90">90</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-91">
These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-92">
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,

<span class="line" id="0-0-93">
Who else would soar above the view of men

<span class="line" id="0-0-94">
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.

I pray you, do.

I am not gamesome: I do lack some part

</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-61">
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-62">
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-63">
I'll leave you.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CASSIUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-65">
Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-66">
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-67">
And show of love as I was wont to have:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-68">
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-69">
Over your friend that loves you.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRUTUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-71">
Cassius,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-72">
Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-73">
I turn the trouble of my countenance
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-74">
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-75">
Of late with passions of some difference,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-76">
Conceptions only proper to myself,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-77">
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-78">
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-79">
Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-80">
Nor construe any further my neglect,
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-80">80</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-81">
Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-82">
Forgets the shows of love to other men.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CASSIUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-84">
Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-85">
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-86">
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-87">
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRUTUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-89">
No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-90">
But by reflection, by some other things.
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-90">90</a>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CASSIUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-92">
'Tis just:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-93">
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-94">
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-95">
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-96">
That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-97">
Where many of the best respect in Rome,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-98">
Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-99">
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-100">
Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-100">100</a>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRUTUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-102">
Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-103">
That you would have me seek into myself
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-104">
For that which is not in me?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CASSIUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-106">
Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-107">
And since you know you cannot see yourself
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-108">
So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-109">
Will modestly discover to yourself
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-110">
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-110">110</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-111">
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-112">
Were I a common laugher, or did use
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-113">
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-114">
To every new protester; if you know
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-115">
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-116">
And after scandal them, or if you know
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-117">
That I profess myself in banqueting
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-118">
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
</span>
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Flourish, and shout</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRUTUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-121">
What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-122">
Choose Caesar for their king.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CASSIUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-124">
Ay, do you fear it?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-125">
Then must I think you would not have it so.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BRUTUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-127">
I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-128">
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-129">
What is it that you would impart to me?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-130">
If it be aught toward the general good,
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-130">130</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-131">
Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-132">
And I will look on both indifferently,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-133">
For let the gods so speed me as I love
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-134">
The name of honour more than I fear death.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CASSIUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-1-136">
I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-137">
As well as I do know your outward favour.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-138">
Well, honour is the subject of my story.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-139">
I cannot tell what you and other men
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-140">
Think of this life; but, for my single self,
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-140">140</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-141">
I had as lief not be as live to be
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-142">
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-143">
I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-144">
We both have fed as well, and we can both
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-145">
Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-146">
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-147">
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-148">
Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-149">
Leap in with me into this angry flood,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-150">
And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
  <a class="line" href="#0-1-150">150</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-1-151">
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in

I know no personal cause to spurn at him,

But for the general. He would be crown'd:
  <a class="line" href="#1-0-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-21">
How that might change his nature, there's the question.
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-22">
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-23">
And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
</span>

And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,

That at his will he may do danger with.

The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins

Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,

More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,

But when he once attains the upmost round.

He then unto the ladder turns his back,

Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees

By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.

Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-37">
Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-38">
Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,

Would run to these and these extremities:

And therefore think him as a serpent's egg

If it were so, it was a grievous fault,

Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?

When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-136">
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-137">
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-138">
And Brutus is an honourable man.
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-139">
You all did see that on the Lupercal
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-140">
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
  <a class="line" href="#2-1-140">140</a>

And, sure, he is an honourable man.

I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,

Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!

This was the most unkindest cut of all;

<span class="line" id="2-1-257">
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
