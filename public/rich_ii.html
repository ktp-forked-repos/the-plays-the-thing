<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-3">
Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-4">
Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-5">
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-6">
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-7">
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-8">
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JOHN OF GAUNT</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-10">
I have, my liege.

<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-12">
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-13">
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-14">
Or worthily, as a good subject should,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-15">
On some known ground of treachery in him?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">JOHN OF GAUNT</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-17">
As near as I could sift him on that argument,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-18">
On some apparent danger seen in him
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-19">
Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-21">
Then call them to our presence; face to face,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-22">
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-23">
The accuser and the accused freely speak:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-24">
High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-25">
In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.

Many years of happy days befal

My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!

Each day still better other's happiness;

<span class="line" id="0-0-32">
Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-33">
Add an immortal title to your crown!

<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-35">
We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-36">
As well appeareth by the cause you come;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-37">
Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-38">
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-39">
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-41">
First, heaven be the record to my speech!
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-42">
In the devotion of a subject's love,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-43">
Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-44">
And free from other misbegotten hate,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-45">
Come I appellant to this princely presence.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-46">
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-47">
And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-48">
My body shall make good upon this earth,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-49">
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-50">
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-50">50</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-51">
Too good to be so and too bad to live,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-52">
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-53">
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-54">
Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-55">
With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-56">
And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-57">
What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THOMAS MOWBRAY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-59">
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-60">
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-60">60</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-61">
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-62">
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-63">
The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-64">
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-65">
As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-66">
First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-67">
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-68">
Which else would post until it had return'd
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-69">
These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-70">
Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-70">70</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-71">
And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-72">
I do defy him, and I spit at him;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-73">
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-74">
Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-75">
And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-76">
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-77">
Or any other ground inhabitable,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-78">
Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-79">
Mean time let this defend my loyalty,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-80">
By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.

<p>
<b class="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-82">
Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-83">
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-84">
And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-85">
Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-86">
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-87">
As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-88">
By that and all the rites of knighthood else,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-89">
Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-90">
What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.

</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THOMAS MOWBRAY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-92">
I take it up; and by that sword I swear
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-93">
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-94">
I'll answer thee in any fair degree,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-95">
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-96">
And when I mount, alive may I not light,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-97">
If I be traitor or unjustly fight!

<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-99">
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-100">
It must be great that can inherit us
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-100">100</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-101">
So much as of a thought of ill in him.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-103">
Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-104">
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-105">
In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-106">
The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-107">
Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-108">
Besides I say and will in battle prove,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-109">
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-110">
That ever was survey'd by English eye,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-110">110</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-111">
That all the treasons for these eighteen years
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-112">
Complotted and contrived in this land
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-113">
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-114">
Further I say and further will maintain
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-115">
Upon his bad life to make all this good,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-116">
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-117">
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-118">
And consequently, like a traitor coward,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-119">
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-120">
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-120">120</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-121">
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-122">
To me for justice and rough chastisement;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-123">
And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-124">
This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-126">
How high a pitch his resolution soars!
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-127">
Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THOMAS MOWBRAY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-129">
O, let my sovereign turn away his face
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-130">
And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-130">130</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-131">
Till I have told this slander of his blood,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-132">
How God and good men hate so foul a liar.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-134">
Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-135">
Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-136">
As he is but my father's brother's son,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-137">
Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-138">
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-139">
Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-140">
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-140">140</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-141">
He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-142">
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">THOMAS MOWBRAY</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-144">
Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-145">
Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-146">
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-147">
Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-148">
The other part reserved I by consent,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-149">
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-150">
Upon remainder of a dear account,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-150">150</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-151">
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-152">
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-153">
I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-154">
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-155">
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-156">
The honourable father to my foe
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-157">
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-158">
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-159">
But ere I last received the sacrament
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-160">
I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-160">160</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-161">
Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-162">
This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-163">
It issues from the rancour of a villain,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-164">
A recreant and most degenerate traitor
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-165">
Which in myself I boldly will defend;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-166">
And interchangeably hurl down my gage

Upon this overweening traitor's foot,

To prove myself a loyal gentleman

Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.

Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,

After your late tossing on the breaking seas?

<b class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</b>
<span class="line" id="2-1-8">
Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-9">
To stand upon my kingdom once again.
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-10">
Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
  <a class="line" href="#2-1-10">10</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-11">
Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-12">
As a long-parted mother with her child
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-13">
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-14">
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-15">
And do thee favours with my royal hands.
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-16">
Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-17">
Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-18">
But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-19">
And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-20">
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet

Which with usurping steps do trample thee:
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-22">
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-23">
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-24">
Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-25">
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-26">
Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-27">
Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
</span>

This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
</span>

Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king

Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
</span>
<span class="line" id="2-1-34">
The means that heaven yields must be embraced,

And not neglected; else, if heaven would,

And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,

Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,

Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen

In murders and in outrage, boldly here;

But when from under this terrestrial ball

And darts his light through every guilty hole,
  <a class="line" href="#2-1-50">50</a>

The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,

His treasons will sit blushing in his face,

Not able to endure the sight of day,
