What, is Horatio there?

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>

A piece of him.

I have seen nothing.

Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,

And will not let belief take hold of him

Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:

Therefore I have entreated him along

<span class="line" id="0-0-61">
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
</span>

That if again this apparition come,

He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-67">
Sit down awhile;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-68">
And let us once again assail your ears,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-69">
That are so fortified against our story

<span class="line" id="0-0-70">
What we have two nights seen.

Well, sit we down,

And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

Last night of all,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-76">
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-77">
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-78">
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,

Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-84">
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-86">
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-88">
Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-90">
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-90">90</a>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-92">
It would be spoke to.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-94">
Question it, Horatio.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-96">
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-97">
Together with that fair and warlike form
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-98">
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-99">
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-101">
It is offended.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-103">
See, it stalks away!

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>

Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!

<p class="stagedir">Exit Ghost</p>
<p>

<span class="line" id="0-0-108">
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-110">
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-110">110</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-111">
Is not this something more than fantasy?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-112">
What think you on't?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-114">
Before my God, I might not this believe
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-115">
Without the sensible and true avouch
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-116">
Of mine own eyes.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-118">
Is it not like the king?

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-120">
As thou art to thyself:
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-120">120</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-121">
Such was the very armour he had on
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-122">
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-123">
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-124">
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-125">
'Tis strange.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-127">
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-128">
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-130">
In what particular thought to work I know not;
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-130">130</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-131">
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-132">
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MARCELLUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-134">
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-135">
Why this same strict and most observant watch
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-136">
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-137">
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-138">
And foreign mart for implements of war;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-139">
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-140">
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-140">140</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-141">
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-142">
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-143">
Who is't that can inform me?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">HORATIO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-145">
That can I;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-146">
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-147">
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-148">
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-149">
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-150">
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-150">150</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-151">
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-152">
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-153">
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-154">
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-155">
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-156">
Against the which, a moiety competent
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-157">
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-158">
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-159">
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-160">
And carriage of the article design'd,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-160">160</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-161">
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-162">
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-163">
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-164">
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-165">
For food and diet, to some enterprise
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-166">
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-167">
As it doth well appear unto our state--
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-168">
But to recover of us, by strong hand
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-169">
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-170">
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-170">170</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-171">
Is the main motive of our preparations,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-172">
The source of this our watch and the chief head
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-173">
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BERNARDO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-175">
I think it be no other but e'en so:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-176">
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-177">
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-178">
That was and is the question of these wars.

A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.

In the most high and palmy state of Rome,

A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-183">
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead

Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:

As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,

The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,

Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
