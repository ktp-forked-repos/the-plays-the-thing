I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon

comes this night to Messina.

A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings

home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
</span>

bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.

Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by

I have already delivered him letters, and there

appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could

In great measure.

A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces

You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a

Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
