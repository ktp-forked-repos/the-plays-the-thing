<p class="stagedir">Warkworth. Before the castle</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter RUMOUR, painted full of tongues</p>

<b class="speaker">RUMOUR</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-4">
Open your ears; for which of you will stop
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-5">
The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-6">
I, from the orient to the drooping west,
</span>

Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-8">
The acts commenced on this ball of earth:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-9">
Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-10">
The which in every language I pronounce,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-10">10</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-11">
Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-12">
I speak of peace, while covert enmity
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-13">
Under the smile of safety wounds the world:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-14">
And who but Rumour, who but only I,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-15">
Make fearful musters and prepared defence,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-16">
Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-17">
Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-18">
And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-19">
Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-20">
And of so easy and so plain a stop
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-21">
That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-22">
The still-discordant wavering multitude,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-23">
Can play upon it. But what need I thus
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-24">
My well-known body to anatomize
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-25">
Among my household? Why is Rumour here?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-26">
I run before King Harry's victory;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-27">
Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-28">
Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-29">
Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-30">
Even with the rebel's blood. But what mean I
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-30">30</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-31">
To speak so true at first? my office is
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-32">
To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-33">
Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-34">
And that the king before the Douglas' rage
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-35">
Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-36">
This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-37">
Between that royal field of Shrewsbury
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-38">
And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-39">
Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-40">
Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,

And not a man of them brings other news

Than they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues

true wrongs.

Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?

I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,

A gentleman well bred and of good name,

That freely render'd me these news for true.

Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent

On Tuesday last to listen after news.

<b class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</b>
<span class="line" id="1-0-54">
My lord, I over-rode him on the way;

And he is furnish'd with no certainties

More than he haply may retail from me.

Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">TRAVERS</b>
<span class="line" id="1-0-60">
My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back
  <a class="line" href="#1-0-60">60</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-61">
With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-62">
Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-63">
A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-64">
That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-65">
He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-66">
I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-67">
He told me that rebellion had bad luck
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-68">
And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-69">
With that, he gave his able horse the head,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-70">
And bending forward struck his armed heels
  <a class="line" href="#1-0-70">70</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-71">
Against the panting sides of his poor jade
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-72">
Up to the rowel-head, and starting so
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-73">
He seem'd in running to devour the way,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-74">
Staying no longer question.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</b>
<span class="line" id="1-0-76">
Ha! Again:
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-77">
Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-78">
Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-79">
Had met ill luck?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</b>
<span class="line" id="1-0-81">
My lord, I'll tell you what;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-82">
If my young lord your son have not the day,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-83">
Upon mine honour, for a silken point
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-84">
I'll give my barony: never talk of it.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</b>

Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers
</span>

Give then such instances of loss?

<p>
<b class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</b>
<span class="line" id="1-0-89">
Who, he?
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-90">
He was some hilding fellow that had stolen
  <a class="line" href="#1-0-90">90</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-91">
The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,
</span>

Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.

Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,
</span>

Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-97">
So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-98">
Hath left a witness'd usurpation.
</span>

Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MORTON</b>
<span class="line" id="1-0-101">
I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-102">
Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-103">
To fright our party.

<p>
<b class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</b>
<span class="line" id="1-0-105">
How doth my son and brother?
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-106">
Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-107">
Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-108">
Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-109">
So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-110">
Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,
  <a class="line" href="#1-0-110">110</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-111">
And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-112">
But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-113">
And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-114">
This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-115">
Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-116">
Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-117">
But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-118">
Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-119">
Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MORTON</b>

Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;

But, for my lord your son--

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</b>
<span class="line" id="1-0-124">
Why, he is dead.
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-125">
See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-126">
He that but fears the thing he would not know
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-127">
Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-128">
That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-129">
Tell thou an earl his divination lies,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-130">
And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
  <a class="line" href="#1-0-130">130</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-131">
And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MORTON</b>
<span class="line" id="1-0-133">
You are too great to be by me gainsaid:
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-134">
Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</b>
<span class="line" id="1-0-136">
Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-137">
I see a strange confession in thine eye:
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-138">
Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-139">
To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-140">
The tongue offends not that reports his death:
  <a class="line" href="#1-0-140">140</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-141">
And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-142">
Not he which says the dead is not alive.
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-143">
Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-144">
Hath but a losing office, and his tongue
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-145">
Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-146">
Remember'd tolling a departing friend.

<p>
<b class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</b>

I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.

I am sorry I should force you to believe

<span class="line" id="1-0-151">
That which I would to God I had not seen;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-152">
But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-153">
Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-154">
To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-155">
The never-daunted Percy to the earth,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-156">
From whence with life he never more sprung up.
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-157">
In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-158">
Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-159">
Being bruited once, took fire and heat away
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-160">
From the best temper'd courage in his troops;
  <a class="line" href="#1-0-160">160</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-161">
For from his metal was his party steel'd;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-162">
Which once in him abated, all the rest
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-163">
Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-164">
And as the thing that's heavy in itself,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-165">
Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-166">
So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-167">
Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-168">
That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-169">
Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-170">
Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester
  <a class="line" href="#1-0-170">170</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-171">
Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-172">
The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-173">
Had three times slain the appearance of the king,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-174">
'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame

Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-176">
Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-177">
Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-178">
A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-179">
Under the conduct of young Lancaster

For this I shall have time enough to mourn.

In poison there is physic; and these news,

Having been well, that would have made me sick,

Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.

<h3>EPILOGUE </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Spoken by a Dancer</p>

<b class="speaker"></b>
<span class="line" id="5-5-3">
First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech.
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-4">
My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-5">
and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-6">
for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-7">
to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-8">
should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-9">
But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-10">
known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here
  <a class="line" href="#5-5-10">10</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-11">
in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-12">
patience for it and to promise you a better. I
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-13">
meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an

<span class="line" id="5-5-14">
ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-15">
you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-16">
I would be and here I commit my body to your
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-17">
mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-18">
as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-19">
If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-20">
you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but
  <a class="line" href="#5-5-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-21">
light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-22">
good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-23">
and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have
</span>
<span class="line" id="5-5-24">
forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the

was never seen before in such an assembly.

One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too

much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will

you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for

not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are
